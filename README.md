# earl-grey
Elegant dark theme for Gitea. 

I mostly bruteforced which colors to change by inspecting every element with undesirable colors, I ended up with a theme that I'm quite proud of. However, it will definitely have a lot of bugs, please report them and fix them!

It's really easy to fix color inconsistencies, just use a color picker to get the color, then Inspect Element and go to the styling section. There, CTRL+F and search for the color (note that the letters must be lowercase, the colors whose letters aren't lowercase are most likely added by me)
